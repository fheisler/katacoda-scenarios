The `ls` command _lists_ what files and folders are in your current directory.

The `ls` command also takes optional _arguments_ that specify the details you want it to provide. These arguments always come after a dash. For instance, running `ls -a` lists _all_ files and folders, including any special files or directories that start with a dot (`.`).

##Â Task

Type `ls`{{execute}} into the prompt at the right to show the contents of your current directory. Then type `ls -a`{{execute}} to show the same results plus `.` and `..`; we'll go over what these mean in the next step.
